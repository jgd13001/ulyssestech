## Project Overview
In James Joyce's Irish modernist novel _Ulysses,_ the protagonists spend a day in the Dublin of 1904, a critical turning point in Irish history in part due to Ireland's increasing globalization at this time. Thanks to the Industrial Revolution and the advent of accessible steamboat travel, in conjunction with the enormous British Empire, Irish engagement with the rest of the world was heightened. 

Yet, as part of this globalized Ireland, Joyce grapples with and criticizes the depictions of Ireland as a largely agricultural and pastoral nation elsewhere in the world. This, then raises the question of what methods he employs to depict Ireland, particularly Dublin, as a modern city on par with cities in other parts of the world. Therefore, we interrogate: what language does Joyce use to discuss technology in Ulysses, and how does its presence push back against a “pastoral” Irish stereotype? How does Ireland’s technological advancement connect to its growing globalization?

The purpose of this project is to use textual data analysis to pay attention to how and where technology appears within the text of _Ulysses._ By performing a distance reading of the entire book that pays attention to the rhetoric surrounding the technological developments recent to 1904, we understand Joyce's treatment of these objects not as advanced, alien technology new to Ireland, but as well-integrated elements of everyday Dublin life.

While recommended for scholars with an emerging interest in Joyce and scholars who wish to determine if text analysis methods suit their own research, this website includes enough context to be accessible to anyone who is interested in learning about James Joyce or his most famous novel.

Below are a couple of ways you might include images in your site. The simplest is to use Markdown's image method. Use a !, then put the alt text you want inside of square brackets, and the link inside of parentheses.

If you want to layout two images side by side, you can use Markdown's tables to organize them into a table of two or more columns... you can add rows for captions if you want.

If you want a single image, center aligned... you have to use raw HTML... use this as a guide, and replace the filename with yours
